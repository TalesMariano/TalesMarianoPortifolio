							<h2>Helpful guide in how to hire me in Canada </h2>
							<h3><i>A Step-by-Step Guide</i></h3>

							<br>


							<h3><i>How about the LMIA?</i></h3>

							<p>An LMIA, or Labour Market Impact Assessment, is a document issued by the Canadian government that assesses the potential impact of hiring a foreign worker on the Canadian labor market. It's a requirement for certain work permit applications.</p>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
									<h3>Step 1: Determine Eligibility</h3>
									<p>Ensure that your company qualifies for the Global Talent Stream under Category B. This category focuses on positions listed on the Global Talent Occupations List, which identifies occupations with skilled worker shortages in Canada.</p>
									<h3>Step 3: Prepare the Job Offer</h3>
									<p>Create a comprehensive job offer for the Unity game developer position. Outline responsibilities, qualifications, technical skills, and any required experience. Clearly state that the position is eligible for the Global Talent Stream program under Category B.</p>
									<h3>Step 5: Submit the Application</h3>
									<p>Submit the application for hiring a Unity game developer through the Global Talent Stream. Include required documents such as the job offer and Labour Market Benefits Plan, as specified by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).</p>
									<h3>Step 7: Receive Confirmation and Work Permit</h3>
									<p>Upon approval, you'll receive IRCC confirmation. The Unity game developer will then receive a work permit, specifying its duration and terms aligned with the job offer.</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								    <h3>Step 2: Confirm the Position</h3>
									<p>Verify that the Unity game developer position is included in the Global Talent Occupations List. Game development roles are often in demand, and if "Unity Game Developer" is listed, you're on the right track.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Step 4: Create a Labour Market Benefits Plan</h3>
									<p>Develop a Labour Market Benefits Plan that explains how hiring a foreign Unity game developer benefits the Canadian labor market and economy. Emphasize job creation, skills transfer, and investments in training.</p>
									<h3>Step 6: Await Processing</h3>
									<p>Expect varying processing times for GTS applications, though the program aims to expedite the process. Stay responsive to any IRCC requests for additional information or clarification.</p>
									<br>
									<h3>Step 8: Welcome the Unity Game Developer</h3>
									<p>Officially welcome the Unity game developer after the work permit is issued. Smoothly transition by providing onboarding and introducing them to the company's culture and role expectations.</p>
								</div>

							<br>
					    	<p>By following these steps, you can hire a skilled Unity game developer through Global Talent Stream's Category B, contributing to your company's growth and the Canadian gaming industry.</p>
						    <p>Remember, immigration policies can change, so refer to the official Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website or consult immigration professionals for accurate information.</p>
